In the main menu, choose to play against the AI or against another person
(Everything was 100% working before I added multiplayer so hopefully everything still works fine)
In the main menu, you can choose the difficulty
	Easy - Player(s) have 5 shuffles and the AI can only place 1 tile at a time
	Medium - Player(s) have 3 shuffles and the AI can place 3 tiles at a time
	Hard - Player(s) have 1 shuffles and the AI can place 6 tiles at a time

When you get a qwirkle ( match 6 tiles), text pops up on screen

You can open the bag to see what tiles are left
You can shuffle your tiles
You can end your turn once you have no more moves
The entire game uses the mouse
